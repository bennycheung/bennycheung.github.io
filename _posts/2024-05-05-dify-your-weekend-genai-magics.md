## Dify as an Education Platform for Learning Hands-on Generative AI Technologies and Implementation Techniques

Generative AI technologies, in their infancy, present a landscape both vast and uncharted. At first glance, the complexity might seem daunting. Yet, the essence of understanding and utilizing these technologies lies not in mastering a steep learning curve overnight but in embracing a journey of incremental discovery.

At its core, Dify serves as an educational gateway to the world of generative AI technologies. Dify can fill the gap of education by presenting a visual learning tools. What sets Dify apart is its Visual AI apps orchestration studio, also known as Low Code/No Code method, a feature that allows users to visually piece together AI components into functional applications. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for individuals without deep programming knowledge, making it an exemplary educational tool. The platform's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline further enriches the learning experience by equipping AI applications with a vast vector database, enabling them to produce accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This feature effectively demonstrates how AI can leverage extensive resources to generate informed responses, providing a practical glimpse into advanced AI functionalities in action.

### Building RAG in 5 minutes

The following illustrates a simple RAG pipeline by using Dify workflow components,

![Dify_Workflow_Knowledge_Retrieval_Chatbot]({{ site.baseurl }}images/dify-your-weekend-genai-magics/Dify_Workflow_Knowledge_Retrieval_Chatbot.jpg)

_Figure. Using Dify's Knowledge Retrieval + Chatbot template, it illustrates a RAG pipeline that can be implemented in 5 minutes._

We can start with Dify's Knowledge Retrieval + Chatbot template to get started. Let's explore how this workflow template functions using the components of Dify, specifically focusing on the simplest form of RAG as depicted:

1. **Start**:
    - This is the initial trigger point of the workflow. It represents the beginning of a process where the AI application starts its operation, typically initiated by a user query or an automated event.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**:
    - This component is key to the RAG setup. It allows the system to query a vast database or knowledge base to retrieve text content that is relevant to the user's question. The purpose of this step is to gather all necessary information that might help in generating a well-informed response. It ensures that the AI has access to a broader set of data beyond its pre-trained model's knowledge.
3. **LLM**:
    - Here, the workflow invokes a powerful language model, in this case, `gpt-3.5-turbo`. Dify has many other LLMs connectivity available in the settings. This model uses the information retrieved in the previous step to understand the context and generate an appropriate response. The model processes natural language inputs and synthesizes information to formulate responses that are not only relevant but also contextually enriched by the retrieved knowledge.
4. **Answer**:
    - The final output of the workflow is generated in this step. The answer module takes the response from the LLM and delivers it as text to the end user. This can be a direct answer to a user's query, a completion of a task, or any other type of response that the application is designed to provide.

We can clone the project from Dify's github repository. 
> [Dify.ai](https://dify.ai/) - github repo: - langgenius/ [dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)

Once we cloned the repository. The easiest way to start the Dify server is to run our [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml) file. Before running the installation command, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```shell
cd dify/docker
docker compose up -d
```

One of the best thing with open source is that we can access the internals and understand how it works, without relying on the fragmented information released by a product company. The features are continuously to grow with a healthy community. If we are development enabled, nothing can stop us to extend the platform by our own codes.

### Docker deployment architecture

The architecture of a system is deployed using Docker, involving multiple services and volumes, and showing the relationships between them. This is a robust setup typical for modern web applications where separation of concerns and data persistence are crucial. The use of Docker and Docker Compose helps in managing these services in an isolated but networked manner, making development, deployment, and scaling more efficient.

## Expanding Dify Reaches - HTTP Request and Tools

Dify presents a straightforward interface. A prominent "Create Custom Tool" button invites crafting something unique. This could be anything, but let's consider a healthcare API tool designed for querying member benefit coverage. It's a specific task, yet one that illustrates the platform's capability to cater to niche requirements with ease.

The essence of Dify's user experience is encapsulated in how it handles tool descriptions and schema. For instance, the healthcare tool mentioned doesn't just float in the digital ether; it's grounded by a clear purpose—enabling users to find member benefit coverage. The schema, adhering to the OpenAPI-Swagger Specification, outlines the structure of API calls in a language that's both standardized and accessible. This means that even those not versed in the intricacies of API development can grasp the tool's workings.

![Dify_Create_Custom_Tool_via_OpenAPI_Spec]({{ site.baseurl }}images/dify-your-weekend-genai-magics/Dify_Create_Custom_Tool_via_OpenAPI_Spec.jpg)

_Figure. The "Create Custom Tool" is specifically showcasing the interface for creating and editing custom tools through the integration of APIs._

Endpoint configuration further demystifies the process, showing exactly how data is received and processed. And with server configurations pointing to a local dev environment, users get a sandbox for experimentation and testing—crucial steps before any rollout.

### Technique to connect local API server

When working with Dify in a local development environment, the challenge often lies in making sure it can communicate with services running on the host machine. This is crucial for testing purposes. The process begins with identifying the host's IP address, which acts as a bridge between Dify, running inside a Docker container, and the local service. By executing `ifconfig`, one might discover their IP to be something like `192.168.50.197`.

With this information, configuring HTTP requests becomes straightforward. For instance, to interact with a service, one would direct requests to local dev server endpoint at `http://192.168.50.197:8001/answer`.

Similarly, to obtain the OpenAPI specification, which is essential for understanding the service's capabilities, URLs like:
- `http://192.168.50.197:8001/docs` for interactive Swagger-UI.
- `http://192.168.50.197:8001/openapi.json` for specification in JSON format are used.

An elegant enhancement to this setup involves the `/etc/hosts` file. By adding an entry such as
```
192.168.50.197 test.me.com
```

One can simplify access to the local service. This not only makes the URLs more readable but also mimics real-world DNS configurations, providing a more realistic environment for testing and development. This approach underscores the importance of seamless interaction between development tools and services, ensuring that testing is both efficient and reflective of actual deployment scenarios.

### Connecting Dify to Local LLM

Integrating Dify with a local LLM through [Ollama]((https://github.com/ollama/ollama)) offers a streamlined approach to leveraging GPU acceleration for our models. Ollama, accessible via a straightforward CLI or a REST API, simplifies the interaction between our applications and the model. Starting is as easy as [downloading and installing Ollama]((https://ollama.ai/download)) from their website.

For those utilizing macOS, pairing Ollama with Docker Desktop enhances the GPU acceleration capabilities. Launching a model, such as `llama3`, is done with a simple command. Ollama takes care of the rest, including downloading the model if it's our first time using it. The `llama3-8b` model, for instance, is efficiently compressed to around 4GB for local use.

```
ollama run llama3
```

> Refer to Ollama official site, it supports numerous open-source LLM models.

[Dify's integration with Ollama](https://docs.dify.ai/tutorials/model-configuration/ollama) is seamless, designed to recognize Ollama as a model provider. When running Ollama on macOS, setting environment variables through `launchctl` is necessary for smooth operation. A quick restart of the Ollama application applies these settings.

```
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
```

Finally, configuring Ollama within Dify completes the setup, making it ready for use. This integration not only simplifies the process but also optimizes the performance of local models through GPU acceleration.
