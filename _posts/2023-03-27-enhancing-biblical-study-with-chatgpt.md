## Understand How to Interact with AI

We start with the understanding of how to interact with AI effectively. By learning how to communicate your needs and inquiries clearly, you can get the most out of your AI-assisted biblical study experience. We will explore tips and strategies for asking questions, providing context, and engaging in meaningful conversations with AI to enhance your understanding of biblical concepts and teachings.

AI language models like ChatGPT act as mirrors in many ways, reflecting the user's interests and knowledge on a given topic. Let's explore these aspects in more detail:

1.  **Your interest/preference**: When engaging with an AI language model, it responds to your specific questions and inquiries, tailoring its responses based on the subjects and themes you express interest in. By doing so, it helps cater to your personal preferences, providing you with information and insights that are most relevant to you.
    
2.  **Your knowledge of the topic**: AI language models can adapt their responses to the level of knowledge or expertise you display. By analyzing the questions and vocabulary you use, ChatGPT can provide more general or detailed responses, depending on your current understanding of the subject. This adaptability makes AI language models useful tools for users with varying levels of expertise in a particular area, such as biblical studies or any other field of interest.

### Context, Context, Context

AI generates an answer based on context for a given question. While traditional search engines like Google provide links to sources that might contain the information you're seeking, AI language models aim to generate a personalized and summarized response based on the context provided in your question.

![AI_Assisted_Bible_Study_Illustration_03]({{ site.baseurl }}images/enhancing-biblical-study-with-chatgpt/AI_Assisted_Bible_Study_Illustration_03.jpg)

The context provided by the user plays a crucial role in determining the accuracy and relevance of the AI-generated response. Without sufficient context or clarification, ChatGPT might misinterpret the question and provide an answer that doesn't align with the user's intended meaning.

For examples,
-   If the user's question is related to mathematics and includes terms like "sin," "cosine," or other mathematical concepts, ChatGPT will recognize the context and generate an answer related to trigonometry.
-   If the user's question is related to Christianity and the term "sin" is used in a religious context, ChatGPT will generate an answer related to the biblical understanding of sin.

Unless the user clarifies context, we can see that AI may misinterpret the question.

#### Begin with Clear Context

Starting your inquiry with a clear context is a powerful approach to ensure an AI language model understands your intent. By specifying a book or resource in your question, you can provide immediate context that helps generate more accurate and relevant responses.

Consider these examples:

-   "Provide an overview of Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis."
-   "What is the main message of the Gospel Primer by Milton Vincent?"
-   "In The Praying Life by Paul E. Miller, why is prayer considered vital?"
-   "Summarize the key points of Biblical Preaching by Haddon Robinson concisely."

#### Importance of Providing Clear Context

When a question lacks sufficient context, AI language models may struggle to determine the user's intent, leading to less accurate and relevant responses. To obtain the most valuable and useful information, users should provide clear context and clarify their questions when interacting with AI.

When given a well-defined context, AI has ample information to work with. For instance:

1.  The user is interested in Christianity and personal spiritual growth, seeking theological education through books.
2.  The AI can then consider the author, doctrine, background, and related resources to generate precise answers.

Such context enables AI to provide more accurate responses.

However, if a user only shares this:

-   "I'm a Christian who believes in the Bible."

The AI can only deduce:

1.  The user is a Christian.
2.  The user is familiar with the Bible.

As a result, the AI may provide more general or vague answers. Providing clear context is essential for receiving more focused and relevant information from AI language models.

### Engaging in Conversations for Accurate Information

Your interactions with AI will differ depending on your specific needs and interests. When seeking answers related to Christian learning, it's essential to mention the Bible to ensure the AI provides relevant verse suggestions. Remember to verify the context of the provided verses to ensure the information aligns with your inquiry.

The following are examples of questions designed to elicit precise answers from the AI:

-   Scriptural
    -   "Please explain James 4:1-4 in simple terms appropriate for a 12-year-old."
    -   "Can you analyze a psalm that uses a chiastic literary structure and explain its significance?"
    -   "What distinguishes the four Gospels in terms of their perspective and content?"
    
-   Personal
    -   "I'm worried about the future. Are there any Bible verses that can provide comfort and guidance?"
    -   "I'm experiencing burnout in ministry. Can you suggest some verses that address this issue?"
    -   "Sometimes I feel unworthy. What does the Bible say about God's love for us despite our shortcomings?"
    
-   Details of Application
    -   "Can you provide some contemporary examples of idolatry that Christians should be aware of?"
    -   "What are some ways Christians can participate in local missions in Toronto?"
    -   "With so many spiritual gifts mentioned in the Bible, how can I determine which one I possess?"

-   Recommendations
    -   "Can you suggest an online commentary that would help me better understand the Book of Exodus?"
    -   "Please recommend some biblically grounded books that can deepen my understanding of Christianity."
    -   "Could you recommend some pastors known for their biblically sound doctrine and briefly describe their teachings?"
    
-   Apologetics (Defence of faith)
    -   "How can God be loving if He hates sin and wickedness as described in the Bible?"
    -   "Why do Christians in the Bible experience suffering and sacrifice if God is good?"
    -   "Given that all Christians believe in the same Bible, what factors contribute to the existence of so many denominations?"
    
-   Debate/conversation in different roles and circumstances
    -   Example: "Assume the role of a non-Christian who has questions about Christianity. Engage in a respectful dialogue with me, asking questions and raising concerns about the Christian faith. This will allow me to practice my apologetics skills and better understand different perspectives."
