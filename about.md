Benny Cheung dedicates this blog to the living computer scientist;
he believes curiosity drives his personal and professional enthusiasm
on the wide range of topics on computing and philosophy.
Surely understanding the beauty of computation is the resounding goal of the blog articles.
Programming a computer to see and draw surely teaches him the most important lesson
that the creative spirit is in the details.
